I have worked for Liberty Mutual since graduating from Seattle University in 2014 with a degree in business economics. I started in commercial underwriting before being selected for a highly competitive program for internal hires to transition into IT. 

When Libertyâ€™s development plan changed and back end programmers were needed, I rose to the occasion and took a hand on approach to bridge the gap between my front-end skills and the back-end demands.

As a result, I am looking to bring my unique combination of technical skills and ability to work cross functionally in an Agile environment with other engineers. I am specialized in understanding tech needs to optimize runtime efficiencies in the entire stack.

I would love the opportunity to demonstrate these skills at a company where I can provide maximum value.

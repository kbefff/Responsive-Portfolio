            <p>My name is Kelsey Beffel. I grew up in a beautiful little house in San Francisco with my parents, older
                brother,
                and twin sister. San Francisco was my playground until I moved to Seattle to go to college in 2010. My
                degree is in
                Busienss Economics with a Spanish minor from Seattle University.</p>
            <p>After graduating I became an underwriter at Liberty Mutual. In 2017 I was aceped into a Liberty run
                program
                for
                employees outside of Commercial Technology to transition into software developer positions. Currently I
                am
                an
                associate software developer at Liberty Mutual.</p>
